### Course Prerequisites

Assume that you are the head of the Computer Science Department at your university. You know all the courses that your program offers--you know what skills are needed in advance of each course and you know what skills each course teaches. Given a specific course, determine which prerequisites you need. To start, do this in such a way that makes it simpler for the administration, by making it quicker to figure out.

Example:

CS1
Needs: None
Teaches: A, B

CS2
Needs: None
Teaches: B, C

CS3
Needs: None
Teaches: B, D

CS4
Needs: None
Teaches: C

CS5
Needs: A, B, C
Teaches: D, E

CS10
Needs: A, D
Teaches: F, G

CS50
Needs: B, C, D, E
Teaches: H, I
