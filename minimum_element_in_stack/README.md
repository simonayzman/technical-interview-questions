## Find the minimum element in a Stack

Use the [STL stack](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/) and its provided functionality to find the minimum element in a stack.

You may ONLY use stacks to complete this project (no other data structures, such as vectors or lists, are allowed). Moreover, the input stack MUST remain unchanged from its original state after the function returns; in other words, the stack has the same values in the same order after the function has completed.
