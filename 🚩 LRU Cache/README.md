### Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache

Implement a least recently used (LRU) cache. This structure should provide the normal get value for key and set value for key functions. The cache has a capacity. Once you hit the capacity and try to add another key/value pair, then you remove key/value pair accessed the longest time ago.
