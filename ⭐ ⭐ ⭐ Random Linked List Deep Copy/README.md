### Random Node Linked List Deep Copy

Assume you have a linked list, whose internal node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to a random node somewhere in the linked list. Implement an algorithm that performs a deep copy of this linked list.

```
 _________      ____    
|         ↓    ↓    |
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> X
     ↓    ⟳    ↓     
     X         X


```
