### Prefix Expression Evaluation

Given a string containing a prefix expression, compute the value of the expression. For example:

Prefix expression:
/ - 15 * / 3 2 5 5
Value = 1.5

Relevant infix expression:
(15 - (3 / 2) * 5) / 5

You could also make this an infix or postfix evaluation problem, but you can just change the order
of where an expression is evaluated via the stack.
