### Wedding Appetizer Table

Imagine a party that has a table of appetizers containing individual plates of vegetable, shrimp,
and beef appetizers. The server behind the table has an interest in giving the oldest dish available
at that table, so as to prevent food poisoning by keeping a dish around longer than it needs to be.
The server can replenish the stock of each appetizer, one dish at a time. A guest can come up to the
table and request one specific appetizer. However, a guest might also not care what he/she receives,
and can therefore request that the server choose the dish themselves. Design and implement a system
that satisfies all of these needs.
