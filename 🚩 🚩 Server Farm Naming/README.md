### Server Farm Naming

Assume that you're building a system of servers. You have a list of servers numbers (starting from the number "1") that represent the server names that have been taken. Find the earliest available name (lowest value number).

Modification 1: Assume that there are different farms, i.e., amazon1, bloomberg1, amazon2, bloomberg3. How would you maintain this?
