### Life Events

Given a list of life events, where a life event is just a [birthYear, deathYear] tuple, find the number of people alive in a specific year. E.g., [[0,6], [12,19], [3,8], [2,5], [7,9]].

Modification 1: How do you find the max population size (and its year), such that it's not O(n^2)?
