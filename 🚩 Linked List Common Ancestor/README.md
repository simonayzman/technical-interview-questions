### Linked List Common Ancestors

![Linked List Common Ancestors Image](linked-list-common-ancestors.png)

Given an arbitrary number of singly linked lists, return the earliest common ancestor node between all the linked lists. You are guaranteed that all of these linked lists converge, at the very least, at one tail node. Therefore, at worst, the result is the tail node. Otherwise, it is possible that all the lists converge earlier.
