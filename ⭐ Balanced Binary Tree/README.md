### Balanced Binary Tree

Implement a function that returns whether a given binary tree is balanced or not.

An empty tree is considered height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if and only if
T's left and right subtrees are both balanced, and the heights of T's left and right subtrees do
not differ by more than 1.
